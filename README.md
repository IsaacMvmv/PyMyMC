# Installation
Unlike my other projects, the setup for this is very easy. It only requires one command.
- Open CMD in the diretory where you extracted the files.

- Do pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run launcher.py

And that's it!

# Features
This launcher allows you access *some* of the features the normal Minecraft launcher does. This includes but is not limited to:

- Downloading Minecraft (all versions supported by the normal launcher)

- Selecting Minecraft versions

- Logging into Minecraft and Mojang account

- Multiplayer support

- Very lightweight

Here are the features planned for the near future:

- Remember me option

- Custom version support

- Better configuration (using JSON to save and have a nice UI to config)
